# Function Pointer in C

This repository contains code examples and explanations related to the concept of function pointers in the C programming language. Function pointers are a powerful and flexible feature in C that allow you to store, pass, and call functions dynamically at runtime. This README provides an overview of the contents and how to use them.


In C, a function pointer is a variable that can store the address of a function. This enables you to create more dynamic and flexible code by allowing you to choose which function to call at runtime. This repository includes a set of examples to help you understand how function pointers work and how to use them effectively in your C programs.

## Examples
Here is a list of the examples included in this repository:

- Basic Function Pointer: Demonstrates how to declare and use a basic function pointer.
- Function Pointer as Arguments: Shows how to pass function pointers as arguments to functions.
- Array of Function Pointers: Illustrates the concept of an array of function pointers.
- Function Pointer in Struct: Demonstrates how to use function pointers within a struct.
- Callback Functions: Explores the use of function pointers as callback functions.
  
Each example comes with source code and comments to explain the underlying concepts and usage.
